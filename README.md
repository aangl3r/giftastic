# giftastic

This is a front-end only application based in HTML and Javascript, styled in CSS

This application makes use of the GIPHY API to return 10 GIFs based on user input.

The app has default buttons that when clicked will generate 10 gifs from the cartoon
named on the button.

The user can type another topic into the form and click Submit, which will generate a
custom button that will also generate 10 GIFs based on what the user named the button

When the user clicks on a GIF, it will begin playing and loop (as GIFs do) until the user 
clicks on the GIF again. When clicked the second time, the GIF will stop (not pause). If
clicked a third time the GIF will play again fom the beginning.
